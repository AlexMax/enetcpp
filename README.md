EnetCPP
-------
A C++ fork of ENet.

- Uses C++14 for better integration into modern game codebases.
- Namespaced to pollute globals as little as possible.
- A new platform abstraction using abstract classes that better encapsulates platform-specific behavior.
- Designed to be vendored and linked statically with your project.
